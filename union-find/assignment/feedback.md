Testing correctness of Percolation
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Running 15 total tests.

Tests 1 through 8 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), it checks the return
values of isOpen(), percolates(), numberOfOpenSites(), and isFull() in that order.
Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.

Tests 13 through 15 test backwash.

9.6x too many calls.
